this  is my app if payment failed due
  to network or anyothe its recorded in
   the db but in the admin and receptionist
    dash  board its still  showing 3/3 rooms available which is good
      but if  i  want to book that same room again it tells me the room
       is booked for that specific day why lets coorect it and also check 
        for me how the cleaning task works for the staff  with the  
        position housekeeper how does it assign cleaning task to them...
        i want the task to be assigned to staff with the position housekeeper, 
        the cleaning job will take place 7:00am and assigned staff with the
         position housekeeper whose staff is in the morning to perform 
         cleaning task to all rooms for that morning same as night, and 
         also if a client checkout the room should be marked as dirty 
         and assigned for cleanup
